# CSS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design
The DriverPass project focused on designing a comprehensive driver-training system for a new company called DriverPass. The client was Liam (the owner), and he wanted a cloud-based, web-accessible system that works from both computers and mobile devices so the business and customers can access information anywhere. This is described in the “CS 255 System Design Document Template Project Two” document. The system was also intended to help customers pass DMV driving tests through structured training, while keeping course content current by incorporating DMV updates and notifying users when rules or policies change, which is also explained in the Project Two system design document.

One thing I did particularly well was translating the interview and project needs into clear functional and nonfunctional requirements that covered both customer and employee workflows. In the “Project One Document,” I captured core capabilities like account creation, appointment scheduling, tracking test progress, role-based access, reservation history/audit tracking, and update notifications. I also included practical quality expectations like cross-platform access, performance considerations, and security requirements like password protections and account lockouts, which are reinforced in the “CS 255 System Design Document Template Project Two” document.

If I could revise one part of my work, I would strengthen the detail around integrations and edge cases—especially the DMV update process and ongoing maintenance workflows. I would improve it by being more specific about how updates enter the system, how failures are handled, and how admins verify and publish new or changed content. I’d also expand on system limitations and assumptions to connect them more directly to risks and mitigation steps (for example, internet outages, vendor dependencies, and what limited offline access would look like), which would make the design even more realistic and implementation-ready.

To interpret the user’s needs, I first identified the main user groups (customers, secretary/admin staff, IT officer, and the owner) and then mapped each group’s goals into system features and access controls. Customers needed accounts, scheduling, training support, and progress visibility; staff needed tools to manage schedules, avoid duplicate reservations, reset passwords, and maintain accountability through logging and reporting. Considering user needs is crucial because it determines whether the system is usable, secure, and actually solves the real problems—if the workflows don’t match how users operate, the system becomes frustrating, leads to mistakes, and creates expensive rework later.

When I approach software design, I start by clarifying goals, defining users and their tasks, turning those tasks into requirements, and then tracing those requirements into models and technical decisions. In the future, I would keep using techniques like use cases and UML diagrams for behavior, a database/data model for structure, and traceability so every requirement clearly connects to a design element. I would also use more early validation, like quick prototypes and acceptance criteria, so testing and maintenance stay aligned with what the system is supposed to deliver.
